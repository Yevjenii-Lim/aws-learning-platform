3. **Real-time Updates**: Comments appear immediately after posting
4. **User Avatars**: See user initials in colored circles
5. **Timestamps**: Relative time display (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
6. **Character Limit**: 1000 character limit with live counter
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

### For Admins

1. **Moderation Ready**: Comments can be easily moderated
2. **User Attribution**: Full user information for each comment
3. **Scalable Storage**: DynamoDB handles unlimited comments
4. **Analytics Ready**: Comment data can be analyzed for insights

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**Table**: `aws-learning-comments`

```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string;              // Unique comment ID
  tutorialId: string;      // Tutorial this comment belongs to
  userId: string;          // User who posted the comment
  userName: string;        // Display name
  userEmail: string;       // User email
  content: string;         // Comment text (max 1000 chars)
  createdAt: string;       // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string;       // ISO timestamp
  likes: string[];         // Array of user IDs who liked
  replies: Comment[];      // Nested replies (future feature)
}
```

### API Endpoints

2. **POST** `/api/tutorials/[tutorialId]/comments`
   - Adds a new comment
   - Requires: `{ content: string }`
   - Returns: `{ success: true, data: Comment }`

## Best Practices

### For Users

- Be respectful and constructive
- Keep comments relevant to the tutorial
- Use clear, helpful language
- Report inappropriate content

### For Content Creators

- Monitor comments for questions
- Respond to user feedback
- Use comments to improve tutorials
- Engage with the community

### For Developers

- Implement proper input validation
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement rate limiting
- Add monitoring and logging
- Consider accessibility features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Comments Not Loading**
   - Check DynamoDB table exists
   - Verify API endpoint is working
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Can't Post Comments**
   - Ensure user is logged in
   - Check authentication tokens
   - Verify character limit

3. **Comments Not Appearing**
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify API response format
   - Check component rendering

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for comments functionality
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key

# DynamoDB table (auto-created)
COMMENTS_TABLE=aws-learning-comments
```

## Performance Considerations

- Comments are paginated to handle large volumes
- DynamoDB queries are optimized for tutorial-based access
- Images are lazy-loaded for better performance
- Client-side caching reduces API calls
- Real-time updates use efficient polling

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics to Track

- Comments per tutorial
- User engagement rates
- Comment quality scores
- Response times
- Error rates

### Logging

- All comment operations are logged
- User actions are tracked
- Error conditions are captured
- Performance metrics are recorded
